**PASSWORD GENERATOR IN PYTHON**

The passwords are random generated every time the user asks for a new password.



In this program we use the **random module**, three variables: **number**, **length** and **password**.

The **number** variable for the number of passwords the user would like to generate, the **length** variable for the length of the password and the **password** variable to store and display the generated password. We also note the use of the **range()** function and a **nested for loop** to generate passwords.
